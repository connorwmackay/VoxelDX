# VoxelDX
This is my attempt at figuring out DirectX 11 by making a voxel game engine. The engine features chunking i.e. where all blocks in a chunk are built into one mesh (all non-visible faces get culled for efficiency). The chunking still needs some updating, for example, I haven't implemented allowing the mesh to be re-built when an update to the chunk occurs.
