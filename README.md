# VoxelDX
This is my attempt at figuring out DirectX 11 by making a voxel game engine. So far I've been working on chunking i.e. where all blocks in a chunk are built into one mesh (all non-visible faces get culled for efficiency). This has been finished, however the chunking still needs some updating. I still need to support rebuilding of the mesh when an update to the chunk occurs.
